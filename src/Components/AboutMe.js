      <p>
        I have an outgoing personality and am a motivated individual who is
        always willing to learn and grow. My objective is to work as a Software
        engineer in a setting that will harness my new talents and support my
        growth in my new found career. Being a previous healthcare provider, I
        have a passion for solving problems and helping people. I have no doubt
        these passions will continue to be fulfilled in the world of STEM.
